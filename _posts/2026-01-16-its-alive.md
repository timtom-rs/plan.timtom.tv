Today I got hot-reload working again! It's a development only feature that is definitely unsound, but when you compile a project in release mode, none of the code related to that feature is included in the build, so "unsound but works most of the time" is a fine place to leave it for now.

Hot-reload is an incredibly useful feature that allows developers to build applications more quickly, and now that it's working again, it will help me speed up the development of Sailbrush. It took several more days to complete than I expected, but I think it was time well spent.

It's also the final feature that I wanted to complete before the initial release of my GUI framework. I'm very excited to show it off and get other developers using it, but code is pretty worthless without some documentation that explains how it works. So, my focus for the next day or two will be getting some documentation ready. I won't have time to write a full tutorial, but I can at least document the basics so other developers aren't totally lost.
