title: "Off Day"

I'll be honest that I was feeling kind of off today. I didn't sleep well last night, so I wasn't as productive as I would have liked. I spent most of the day diving down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out what the best way to support Linux would be. I didn't originally plan on thinking about that for several months, but some comments on the Rosin issue tracker sucked me in! I blame you all. ;)

I'm gonna go to bed early tonight and get back to actual coding tomorrow.
