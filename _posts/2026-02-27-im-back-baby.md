title: "I'm Back, Baby!"
---

I spent most of the day coding, and it feels great to make tangible progress. Much better than the nebulous and hard to define progress that comes with doing research and reading documentation. I also spent some time working on a video script. I won't start making it any time soon, but I wanted to write things down while they're fresh in my mind.

In terms of relative importance, this project is half development, half communication, so I feel good about my time spent on both of these tasks.

I don't expect to get any work done over the weekend because my friend Gary just finished writing a novel, and I promised him I'd read it and give notes. Gary can be seen doing sick flips in [my parkour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIRELnXmAgg).
