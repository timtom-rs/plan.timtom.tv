title: "Being Needed"
---

I recently listened to [a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQU6u5dgD98) that referenced a study on what age people feel happiest. My main takeaway was that having responsibilities and people depending on you is what leads to feeling the most fulfilled.

This morning at around 2:30 am one of my closest friends called me and needed someone to talk to. I hope I was able to give her good advice despite being half asleep. In any event, it feels good to be needed, and I'm really glad she could depend on me.

So, I decided to sleep in a bit instead of going to the gym, but I was still able to get to work before 8:30 am.

I spent today working on hot-reload some more. It's a bit more complicated than I made it sound yesterday, but I know what needs to be done, and I'm making good progress. It's a feature that will only be used during development, so it's probably ok if it's a little rough around the edges.

Also, someone I used to work for contacted me and said they were excited about Sailbrush and want to make a substantial contribution to the fundraiser! Hopefully I'll have more information next week. I gotta say, it feels great that this many people believe in me.

I'm gonna go make dinner and then try to squeeze a few more hours of work in before bed.
