I've been working on this GUI library on and off since 2018. It feels a little strange to be this close to publishing it for the whole world to use and scrutinize. Before, it was just for me, and I could see past any flaws or shortcomings, but strangers on the internet aren't likely to be as forgiving. I imagine this is similar to how parents feel when they drop their kids off for the first day of school.

So, I'd like to spend more time polishing up every little detail, adding tons of example apps, and building more widgets so that it can make the best possible first impression. But of course, I need to realize that it will never be done. There will always be bugs to fix, performance to enhance, and features to add. This is just the beginning.

The set of widgets that I'm starting with is admittedly a little anemic, but the foundation they're built on is very solid. I suppose that's as good a state as any for the initial release.

But right now, I must sleep. Some friends and I are going to learn how to make sushi tomorrow. Assuming I don't get food poisoning, a Sunday release looks likely.
