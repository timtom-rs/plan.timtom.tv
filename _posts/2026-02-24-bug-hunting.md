When you find a bug in software, the best way to ensure it gets fixed quickly is to submit exact instructions on how to reproduce it. If it's in a library, you want to provide the minimal code needed to trigger the bug.

A while ago I found a bug in the rendering library that I'm using, and I decided that today was the day to put together a minimal repro to help them fix it more easily.

The problem is, I spent most of the day trying to reproduce the bug, and I can't! It shows up in Rosin, but when I try to write code to trigger it directly, everything works exactly as you'd expect. Very strange! Maybe once I've slept on it, I'll have better luck.
