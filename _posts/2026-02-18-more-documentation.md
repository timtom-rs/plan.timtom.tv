title: "More Documentation"
---

I kinda feel bad that I didn't have the energy for a longer update yesterday, but I think after spending all day writing documentation, it was hard to find the juice to write any more.

I am similarly out of writing juice today.

But the documentation is coming along nicely! It's always kind of annoying to try to use a library that doesn't have good docs, so I want to do what I can to avoid annoying other developers.

Making my GUI library well documented and easy to use has two primary benefits. One, the more people use it, the more bugs will be found and fixed before they have a chance to impact Sailbrush users. And two, the easier it is to use and understand, the easier it will be for developers to contribute to Sailbrush.
