title: "Movie Night"
---

I spent all of today getting hot-reload working again. It's Very Close&trade;, but not 100% yet. I'm a little upset that it's taken several days, but it's worth spending time on because it makes developing everything else much faster.

I have some friends coming over soon for a little movie night. The great thing about hosting is that the second everyone leaves I can go right back to coding, haha.

This first week has been a massive success! I've probably said it a little too often, but I'm enormously grateful to have this opportunity to work on something meaningful and fun. Thank you all.
